# GuessIt-Game

Java simple game.

## Synopsis

The "game" [original idea](https://github.com/dfzunigah/GuessIt-Game/releases/tag/v1.0.0) was taken from a MOOC from the University of Helsinki. I took the idea and developed it further adding new features and stuff. It's a simple program but it involves almost everything of Java basics. It also set the opportunity to learn how GitHub works and learn more about how to develop projects and software. I'd appreciate any improvement you can tell me or what I can do better. I'm starting to code so not that into big deals but I learn fast :)

## Motivation

This is a simple "game", I started developing it in a way I could also try and test GitHub.

## Installation

Releases just include a simple .JAR file, so no installation required, just open it. In any case you'd like to see the "compiled code" you can change the extension of the file, like this: guessgame.jar -> guessgame.jar.zip, this will generate a ZIP file where you can find the code. Also you can see the source code with this useful tool: [JD GUI] (http://jd.benow.ca/), this allows you to decompile .JAR files.

## API Reference

Changelog of the program can be found [here](https://github.com/dfzunigah/GuessIt-Game/blob/master/Documentation.pdf)

## Tests

The program has been tested and all visible bugs have been removed, anyways if you realize there's something wrong, give me a shotout. This is a very basic program so there's no test battery.
